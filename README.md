Guidelines for getting started using HDL Coder to generate VHDL or Verilog to target FPGA or ASIC hardware. The document provides practical guidance for:
* Setting up your MATLAB algorithm or Simulink model for HDL code generation
* How to create HDL-ready Simulink models, Stateflow charts, and MATLAB Function blocks
* Tips and advanced techniques for HDL code generation
* Code generation settings for specific FPGA/SoC targets, including AXI interfaces
* Converting to fixed-point or utilizing native floating-point
* Optimizing for various goals and targets
* Verifying your generated code

Examples are included to illustrate selected concepts.
